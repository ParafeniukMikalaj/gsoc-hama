      <strong>Apache Hama</strong> is a distributed computing framework based on 
      BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing techniques for massive scientific computations, 
      e.g., matrix, graph and network algorithms. 
      It was inspired by Google's Pregel, but different in the sense 
      that it's purely BSP and common model, not just for graph.

    <subsection name="Disclaimer"></subsection>
      <p>
       Apache Hama is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
      sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
      communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
      it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
